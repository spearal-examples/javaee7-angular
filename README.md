# Java EE 7 - Angular - Sample Application #

## How to run? ##

You need a Git client, a JDK 7 or higher and Maven 3:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/spearal-examples/javaee7-angular.git
$ cd javaee7-angular
$ mvn clean install wildfly:run
```

Then, you can access the Spearal version at http://localhost:8080/javaee7-angular-3.1/index-spearal.html and the original JSON one at http://localhost:8080/javaee7-angular-3.1/index.html.
